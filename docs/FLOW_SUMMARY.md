# Movie Recommendation Wizard - Flow Summary

## Quick Reference

### 🎯 Core Pattern
**One Question → User Selection → Explicit Confirmation → Next Question**

### 📋 6-Step Process
1. **🎭 Genres** (Multi-select) → "Great combo!"
2. **😊 Mood** (Single-select) → "Perfect choice!" 
3. **📅 Decade** (Single-select) → "Awesome!"
4. **⭐ Rating** (Single-select) → "Excellent!"
5. **🌍 Language** (Single-select) → "Fantastic!"
6. **📧 Email** (Input/Skip) → "Get My Recommendation!"

### ✅ Key Rules
- ✅ **No auto-advance** - every step needs button click
- ✅ **Visual feedback** - "Perfect! You selected..." messages
- ✅ **Edit capability** - go back and change any previous answer
- ✅ **Progress tracking** - visual bar showing completion percentage
- ✅ **Multi-select genres** - can pick multiple, others single-choice
- ✅ **Email optional** - can skip and still get recommendation

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind + Framer Motion
- **State Management**: React useState with confirmation flow control
- **APIs**: OpenAI (recommendations) + TMDB (movie data) + EmailJS (delivery)
- **UX**: Dark theme with gold accents, smooth animations, glassmorphism
